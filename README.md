## How to use my dotfiles
- Neovim 0.12+ installed
    - You can install through [bob](https://github.com/MordechaiHadad/bob)
    ```bash
    bob install nightly
    ```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tnhannnn/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```
- You can clone my github to another directory like nvim-nightly and then use alias like me
```zsh
alias nn='NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-nightly nvim'
```
*this will load nvim with my nightly config* 
```zsh
alias nv='NVIM_APPNAME=nvim nvim'
```
*this will load nvim with my stable config*
